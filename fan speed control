first of all    hardware and kernel both support fan speed control
lm_sensors;fancontrol
configuring or completely stopping fans on high cpu/system load may result in permanently damaged hardware
laptop usrs should be aware how cool system works  
laptops have a single fan for both cpu and gpu and cools both at the same time     some laptops have two fans for cpu and gpu but the first fan cools down 
cpu and gpu at the same time while the other one cools cpu only   
in some cases you cannot use fancontrol script due to incompatible cooling architecture (e.g. one fan for both cpu and gpu )
