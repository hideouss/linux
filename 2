write note core reason : human memory nature  curve    just write understanding notes

key is user key is information  key is information security (zuckerberg invest a lot money in security)
key is direction  simple is a line  a line a line  just let it work firstly   then upgrade it  let it flexible and stable   
so much options means so flexible and stable   but it is added later  not the first wrok  first work just let it work  a line  a line   a line 
UI must be very simple simple simple  drop-down menu is very silly never drop down UI
the real work is real understanding not single a file not make sense   it is a stsyem a lot file make sense   just understand not just silly UI
