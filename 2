write note core reason : human memory nature  curve    just write understanding notes
everything is change   so just see the aim goal what achieved or what to achive     most important is   direction 
understanding one thing just think the future change   then will find real thing need to understand 
use CLI not GUI      CLI is reliable 
git and usb flash drive  let me annoy   but  it is very flexible and stable      flexible + stable 
i write understanding notes by myself not detail notes
microsoft like do really beautiful UI
key is user key is information  key is information security (zuckerberg invest a lot money in security)
key is direction  simple is a line  a line a line  just let it work firstly   then upgrade it  let it flexible and stable   
so much options means so flexible and stable   but it is added later  not the first wrok  first work just let it work  a line  a line   a line 
UI must be very simple simple simple  drop-down menu is very silly never drop down UI
the real work is real understanding not single a file not make sense   it is a stsyem a lot file make sense   just understand not just silly UI
never use drop-down menu  it is very silly      git could do same thing in differ ways
the best thing is understanding thing not single single single         github just excellent hosting service
gmail is web interface
speaking english is poor maybe pronunciation but could read write indeed thinking in english
linux brace expansion: could nest   could enable and disable via set -B;set +B;
nest + recursive 
the whole direction is wrong just direct do a project then patch it 
ubderstanding is most important  most vital most useful like git internal  it will be useful for others 
command is not internal  internal is file  is source code     bash brace expansion
basic operation is easy first not to deep it just let it work as soon as possible then dig it
