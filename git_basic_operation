1:sign up github account 
2:create a new repository  just type repository name    select public   
3:in local terminal git      create a directory 
4:change into directory
5:create a file like README.md and write soemthing in it      for example   echo "#demo" >> README.md
6:git init       git add README.md
7:make a commit   git commit -m "commit message"   must always write a message in commit
8:connect local to remote like github     git remote add url_replace_name url(like github repository)
9:push local code to remote like github    git push -u url_replace_name master     need username and password
remove git version control:just delete .git    rm -rf .git 
basic git operations:clone modify add delete files in git    
git add can be used when adding a new file to git     modifying contents of an existing file   deleting a file in git
1:clone    local is empty    find the clone https    git clone clone_https
2:modify a file      first change local terminal file content   now could run git diff see the differ  (if has runed git add now must git diff --cache see differ) 
2:git add modify_file_name       git commit -m "commit message"     git push -u url_replace_name master
3:add a file     first add a file in local terminal      git add add_file_name      git commit -m "commit message"      git push -u replace_url_name master 
4:delete a file    fitst delete local file   rm file_name      git add file_name    git commit -m "commit message"   git push -u replace_url_name master 
actual important is know who is  under verison control  like has a .git file    delete .git  will quit verison control  
git revert to past commit(version):
see git special commit content in snapshot :
git could revert commit or stage area or work tree:
current directory is under git manage  because of .git  whether sub directory is under git manage:
git add wrong information so how to manage stage area:
why not direct commit has to add to staging area then commit  stage differ commit  why i need stage before commit:      
just add but not commit what it looks like:
if i new a file in git but not track it then i delete the file  the file will lose
local git repository connect to remote repository: git remote
when i clone a repository from remote server git automatically remember connection for me  it auto calls remote as origi   
git add could choose what to add but git commit only whole not piece like other souce manage tools  it's snapshot
git restore to git know state 
SHA1 40-digits 0x form:calculate object content 
echo "s" >> file11.txt | git hash-object --stdin; echo "s" | git hash-object --stdin;
SHA1 hashes based on content if content is same it  will be same  
.git's objects : blob(binary data) tree commit tag
blob(single file):git show SHA-1    tree(contain pointers to blobs trees):git ls-tree SHA-1 
commit(tree parent author commiter commit message): git show -s --pretty=raw SHA-1
.git:tree -L 1:   HEAD:pointer to current branch     refs:pointers to branches
git configure username and e-mail  ~/.gitconfig     git clone could operate multi-protocol(transfer protocol) ssh://  https:// git://
git commit -a : shoutcut could use but except new file   
git diff   git diff --cached
git branch:list branches   git branch branch1:create a new branch named branch1    git checkout branch1 : switch to branch branch1
git merge branch1;git branch -d/D branch1;
normally,a merge results in a merge commit with two parents   but if a current branch has not diverged from the other:fast forward merge
in a word   when i merged whether has a new commit         asterisk + brace expansion(how to operate like this just see the source code)
see objects database content : git cat-file -p SHA-1     see object type : git cat-file -t SHA-1
create a new file and save its content in database: echo 'version 1' > test.txt; git hash-object -w test.txt;
