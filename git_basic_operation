basic git operations:clone modify add delete files in git    
git add can be used when adding a new file to git     modifying contents of an existing file   deleting a file in git
1:clone    local is empty    find the clone https    git clone clone_https
2:modify a file      first change local terminal file content   now could run git diff see the differ  (if has runed git add now must git diff --cache see differ) 
2:git add modify_file_name       git commit -m "commit message"     git push -u url_replace_name master
3:add a file     first add a file in local terminal      git add add_file_name      git commit -m "commit message"      git push -u replace_url_name master 
4:delete a file    fitst delete local file   rm file_name      git add file_name    git commit -m "commit message"   git push -u replace_url_name master 
actual important is know who is  under verison control  like has a .git file    delete .git  will quit verison control  
git revert to past commit(version):
see git special commit content in snapshot :
git could revert commit or stage area or work tree:
current directory is under git manage  because of .git  whether sub directory is under git manage:
git add wrong information so how to manage stage area:
why not direct commit has to add to staging area then commit  stage differ commit  why i need stage before commit:      
just add but not commit what it looks like:
if i new a file in git but not track it then i delete the file  the file will lose
local git repository connect to remote repository: git remote
when i clone a repository from remote server git automatically remember connection for me  it auto calls remote as origi
